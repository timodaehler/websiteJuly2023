Thanks for stopping by! 

I have an academic background in economics and professional experience in risk management. When I don't spend my free time discovering the Swiss alps or California's Eastern Sierra, I dabble in data science: Over the years, I have grown a particular interest in data visualization and coummunicating data-driven insights. 

If you think we could collaborate on cool work, I'd love to hear from you!
