Welcome to my corner of the internet, where numbers meet nature and investments meet adventures! By day, I'm a mild-mannered economist, crunching data and navigating the treacherous world of risk management with the precision of a Swiss watch. By night (and on weekends), I trade in my spreadsheets for hiking boots, exploring the high peaks of the Swiss Alps and the untamed wilderness of California's Eastern Sierra. It's all about balance—whether that's on a narrow mountain trail or in a complex financial model.

This website started as a side project in February 2024, born from a mix of curiosity, caffeine, and a stubborn belief that the secret to a good investment is not what you buy, but what you pay for it. Hence, I'll use this platform to find ways for different asset classes to identify if "the price is right". 

If you resonate with my journey or see potential for collaboration, I'm open to connecting!
