At heart, I'm a macroeconomist who transitioned to the meticulous world of risk management as a quantitative analyst.

When I'm not designing models, analyzing data, or identifying potential risks, you'll find me adventuring through the picturesque Swiss Alps or exploring the rugged beauty of California's Eastern Sierra. Through this website, I channel my curiosity into investment analysis, always on the lookout for intriguing insights and future trends.

If you resonate with my journey or see potential for collaboration, let's connect!
