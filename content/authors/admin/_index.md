I'm a trained economist working in the field of risk management. 

Beyond the realm of model design, data analysis, and risk identification, my adventures take me through the picturesque Swiss Alps and the rugged terrain of California's Eastern Sierra. On this website, I channel my curiosity into investment analysis, always on the lookout for new insights and emerging trends.

If you resonate with my journey or see potential for collaboration, I'm open to connecting!
