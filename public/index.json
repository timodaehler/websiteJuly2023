I’m speaking to you tonight to give you a report on the state of our Nation’s economy. I regret to say that we’re in the worst economic mess since the Great Depression. A few days ago I was presented with a report I’d asked for, a comprehensive audit, if you will, of our economic condition. You won’t like it. I didn’t like it. But we have to face the truth and then go to work to turn things around. And make no mistake about it, we can turn them around. I’m not going to subject you to the jumble of charts, figures, and economic jargon of that audit, but rather will try to explain where we are, how we got there, and how we can get back. First, however, let me just give a few “attention getters” from the audit. The Federal budget is out of control, and we face runaway deficits of almost USD80 billion for this budget year that ends September 30th. That deficit is larger than the entire Federal budget in 1957, and so is the almost USD80 billion we will pay in interest this year on the national debt. - Ronald Reagan, Address to the Nation on the Economy, February 5, 1981 Heeding Nixon’s advice, the FED under Paul Volcker aggressively tackled inflation, implementing a Federal Funds Rate of 22%—yes, that’s 22%, not 2.2%! Additionally, a bipartisan effort led to significant reforms in the tax code and addressed the structural factors contributing to government expansion. To cut a long story short, the monetary and fiscal measures proved effective. Within just two years, the inflation rate plummeted from double digits to a more manageable 2-3%, a level at which it remained for the following decades. Moreover, the overhaul of the tax system and government spending gradually led to increasingly balanced government finances, ultimately resulting in a budget surplus by 1998 during Clinton’s administration. How different the word looks in 2023: The federal budget deficit has ballooned to USD 1695 billion, roughly equivalent to the total federal budget in 1988, Reagan’s last year in office. Despite the current lower interest rates compared to the onset of Reagan’s term, government interest payments have soared to approximately USD 800 billion, a stark increase from the USD 133 billion during the start of Reagan’s presidency. And there is no end in sight. According to the CBO most recent projections, the U.S. is on route to a deficit of USD 1539 billion or 5.9% of GDP in 2024. Zooming out further, the CBO projects a deficit of USD 2852 billion or 7.3% in 2033.\nWith these numbers astronomically high, the rest of this article sets out to address four questions:\nWhat could be the consequences of continued deficit spending?\nAre we near a debt crisis?\nHow do financial markets and the deficit interplay?\nWhat’s a way out of these deficits?\nGovernment has only two ways of getting money other than raising taxes. It can go into the money market and borrow, competing with its own citizens and driving up interest rates, which it has done, or it can print money, and it’s done that. Both methods are inflationary.\nWe can leave our children with an unrepayable massive debt and a shattered economy, or we can leave them liberty in a land where every individual has the opportunity to be whatever God intended us to be. All it takes is a little common sense and recognition of our own ability. Together we can forge a new beginning for America. - Ronald Reagan, Address to the Nation on the Economy, February 5, 1981 Open in Fullscreen Open in Fullscreen ","date":1562889600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562889600,"objectID":"07e02bccc368a192a0c76c44918396c3","permalink":"https://timodaehler.com/post/writing-technical-content/","publishdate":"2019-07-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/writing-technical-content/","section":"post","summary":"In 1981—amid double-digit inflation, burgeoning deficits, and anemic growth—President Reagan warned his fellow citizens about out-of-control government finances:\nGood evening.
